# Object Detection and Tracking Website

This is a web application that performs object detection and tracking using TensorFlow.js, COCO-SSD, and OpenCV. It allows you to use your webcam to detect and track objects in real-time.

## Features

- Real-time object detection using the webcam
- Object tracking for detected objects
- Display of object class and confidence score
- Highlighting of detected objects in the live video feed
- - Continuous tracking of objects as they move within the video frame


Technologies Used
-TensorFlow.js: A JavaScript library for training and deploying machine learning models in the browser.
-COCO-SSD: A pre-trained object detection model that can detect 80 different object classes.
-OpenCV: A computer vision library used for object tracking.
